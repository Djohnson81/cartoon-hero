		<!-- About -->
		<h2>About Doctor Strange</h2>
		<p>Strange was once a brilliant but arrogant neurosurgeon, until a car accident crippled his hands.[13] When modern medicine failed him, he embarked on a journey to Kamar-Taj in Tibet, where he was trained by the Ancient One.  He healed his hands and learned more about Magic, eventually becoming a Master of the Mystic Arts.</p>
